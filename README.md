### Development Process
#### Version 1
The MVP has a single user creating games that belong to them and can be viewed by them alone.

The first thing i did was to write shell scripts to confirm access to the API endpoints.

Forms were created for the desired functions and the CRUD operations

Events for the submit actions were created and linked to the API calls

### Version 2
In v2 the user will be able to sign up as part of a team and see team info
